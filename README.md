TellerSite
TellerSite is a straightforward CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application that allows users to manage client information in a database. It focuses primarily on backend functionality and database interaction.

Due to time constraints, this version uses basic HTML and CSS for the front end, without any frontend frameworks. However, a rewrite using React is planned for the future.

This project can be adapted to manage clientele and merchandise in real-world small business environments.
