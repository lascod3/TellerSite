TellerSite is a straightforward CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application that allows users to manage client information efficiently. The system interacts with a MySQL database and provides basic functionalities to add, view, edit, and delete client data.

Due to time constraints, no front-end frameworks were usedâ€”only basic HTML and CSSâ€”with the primary focus placed on functionality and backend logic. However, a future version of the project will be rewritten using React for a more dynamic and modern UI.

The application can be adapted for real-world use to track clientele and merchandise.
